# Upgrade fails because of VerifyNoLegacyReportsDashboards.dll prerequisite

## Affected versions

DataMiner 10.4.0 or newer.<!-- RN 37786 -->

## Cause

From DataMiner 10.4.0 onwards, the [legacy Reporter](xref:reporter) and [legacy Dashboards](xref:dashboards) modules are *End of Life*. These have been replaced by the [Dashboards app](xref:newR_D). The *VerifyNoLegacyReportsDashboards* upgrade prerequisite check verifies that no legacy reports and legacy dashboards still exist before upgrading, as these will no longer work after the upgrade.

## Fix

If you no longer need the legacy Reporter and Dashboards modules, remove any existing legacy reports and legacy dashboards by deleting them in the Reporter and Dashboards modules. Note that other DataMiner modules, such as Automation, Scheduler, and Visual Overview, may also make use of these.

If you still rely on certain functionality and want to keep on using the legacy Reporter and Dashboards modules, set the [*LegacyReportsAndDashboards* soft-launch option](xref:Overview_of_Soft_Launch_Options#legacyreportsanddashboards) to *true*, then run `C:\Skyline DataMiner\Tools\ConfigureIIS.bat` as Administrator, and restart the DataMiner Agent.

## Issue description

Upgrading to 10.4.0 or newer will disable the legacy Reporter and legacy Dashboards. Any scheduled reports generated by the legacy Reporter will no longer work.
