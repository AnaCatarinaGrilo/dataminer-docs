### Enhancements

### Fixes

#### SLAnalytics - Pattern matching: A match of one subpattern would incorrectly be considered a match of the entire multivariate pattern [ID_38587]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU1] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When the streaming method was being used, a match detected for one subpattern of a multivariate pattern would incorrectly be considered a match of that entire multivariate pattern.

Although the suggestion events were generated correctly, the pattern matches would not be indicated correctly on the trend graphs.
