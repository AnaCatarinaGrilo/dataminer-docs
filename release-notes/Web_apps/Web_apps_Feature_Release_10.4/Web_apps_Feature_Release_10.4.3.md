### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - GQI: Queries would be fetched twice [ID_38335]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In some cases, a query would be fetched twice: once with old feed values filled in and once with new feed values filled in.

As the component was still in a loading state, users would only notice that it took longer for the data to appear.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - GQI: Problem when multiple column manipulations had been configured on the same column [ID_38338]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] - FR 10.4.3 -->

In some cases, a query would throw an error when multiple column manipulations had been configured on the same column.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Generic map component: No longer possible to select a map configuration file [ID_38394]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU12] - FR 10.4.3 -->

When configuring a *Generic map* component, it would incorrectly no longer be possible to select a map configuration file.
