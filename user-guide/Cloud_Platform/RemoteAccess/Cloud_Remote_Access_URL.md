# Finding the remote access URL

1. Open the [Admin app](xref:Accessing_the_Admin_app).

1. Go to the *Overview* page for the DataMiner System.

   The URL is displayed right underneath the name of the connected DataMiner System. You can copy it or navigate to the URL directly.

> [!TIP]
> The URL usually has the format `https://[dms_name]-[company_name].on.dataminer.services`, although this depends on what was configured when the DMS was connected to dataminer.services.
