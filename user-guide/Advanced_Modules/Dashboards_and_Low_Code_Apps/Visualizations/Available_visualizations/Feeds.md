# Feeds

Feeds can be added to a dashboard to allow a user to select a DataMiner object for which information can be displayed in other components.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Feeds can be pre-configured in dashboard URLs. See [Specifying data input in a dashboard URL](xref:Specifying_data_input_in_a_dashboard_URL).
> - The [Dropdown](xref:DashboardDropdown) visualization is also a type of feed, but from DataMiner 10.3.5/10.4.0 onwards<!--  RN 35902 -->, it is available under *Basic controls* instead.

> [!TIP]
