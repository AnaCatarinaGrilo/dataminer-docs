# Frequently asked questions

### What are DataMiner credits?

DataMiner credits are a form of currency used to subscribe to DataMiner software and hosting services.

> [!TIP]
> For more information, see [Usage terms](xref:Pricing_Usage_based_service#usage-terms).

### Where can I check the current DataMiner credit balance of my organization?

The DataMiner credit balance of an organization is displayed in the [Admin app](https://admin.dataminer.services/).

### How can I acquire more DataMiner credits?

Contact [your Account Manager](https://community.dataminer.services/get-in-touch/sales-team/).

### When does a DaaS system expire?

A DataMiner Express DaaS system will be scheduled to expire as soon as the organization does not have sufficient DataMiner credits to extend its lifetime.

> [!NOTE]
> When an organization has multiple DaaS systems, they will be extended in chronological order. When your organization does not have enough credits left to extend one of your DaaS systems, that DaaS system will be scheduled to expire. However, at this point, you may still have a number of DataMiner credits left that will be considered reserved for your other DaaS systems.

### What happens when my DaaS system expires or is deleted?

Your DaaS system along with all its associated resources and data will be irreversibly deleted.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an owner of the organization of a DaaS system or an owner of a DaaS system, you will get an email notification if your system is about to expire, for example because you do not have enough DataMiner credits left. Depending on how many DataMiner credits you use for other purposes, you will get this notification up to 5 days before the system expires. Another email notification will be sent when the system effectively expires.

### How can I manually delete my DaaS system?

You can delete your DaaS system at any time before its expiration. See [Removing a DaaS system](xref:Removing_a_DaaS_system).

### How can I create a new DaaS system?

Follow the instructions under [Creating a new DMS on dataminer.services](xref:Creating_a_DMS_on_dataminer_services).
