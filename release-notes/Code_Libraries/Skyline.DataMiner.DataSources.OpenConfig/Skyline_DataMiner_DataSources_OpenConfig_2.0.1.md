# Skyline DataMiner DataSources OpenConfig 2.0.1

## Fixes

#### Element using Cisco Nexus 3.0.5.6 connector logged null reference exceptions [ID_37872]

In some cases, it could occur that an element running the Cisco Nexus 3.0.5.6 connector logged null reference exceptions in the element logging generated by the DataMapper. This happened because this connector occasionally sends out notifications without value and the DataMapper did not expect this.

A null check has now been added to discard these notifications, so that this issue will no longer occur. Note that the issue did not have any functional impact.
